At the beginning of the exersize, I created a new directory called lab06. In that directory I started a script file called typescript for you to review. Next, I downloaded a recourse from the internet using the wget command and inserted it into my lab06 directory. That resource was gzip folder that I then copied to another directory that I had to create using the sudo command. Once in that directory, I extracted the gzip folder and that created a new directory under /data/aircraft and the folder name is configs. Under that folder name, I listed any file that used .ini anywhere in the title in any directory under my current working one. I then searched inside of every folder below my current working folder for the string AES-128. I then did that command again and pipelined it to a less command and listed the line numbers of what was found using the grep tool. Doing that went ahead and counted how many files contained AES-128 string and it showed me the file paths for every file that contained the same string. You should now be able to see what files I saw when I used the grep command from before because I redirected the output to a file called AES-128 under /data/aircraft.
