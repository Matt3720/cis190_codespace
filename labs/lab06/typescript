[1mDESCRIPTION[0m[m
       GNU Wget is a free utility for non-interactive download of files from the Web.  It supports HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP protocols, as well as retrieval through HTTP[m
       proxies.[m
[m
       Wget is non-interactive, meaning that it can work in the background, while the user is not logged on.  This allows you to start a retrieval and disconnect from[m
       the system, letting Wget finish the work.  By contrast, most of the Web browsers require constant user's presence, which can be a great hindrance when[m
       transferring a lot of data.[m
[m
       Wget can follow links in HTML, XHTML, and CSS pages, to create local versions of remote web sites, fully recreating the directory structure of the original[m
       site.  This is sometimes referred to as "recursive downloading."  While doing that, Wget respects the Robot Exclusion Standard ([4m/robots.txt[24m).  Wget can be[m
       instructed to convert the links in downloaded files to point at the local files, for offline viewing.[m
[m
       Wget has been designed for robustness over slow or unstable network connections; if a download fails due to a network problem, it will keep retrying until the[m
       whole file has been retrieved.  If the server supports regetting, it will instruct the server to continue the download from where it left off.[m
[m
[1mOPTIONS[0m[m
   [1mOption[0m [1mSyntax[0m[m
       Since Wget uses GNU getopt to process command-line arguments, every option has a long form along with the short one.  Long options are more convenient to[m
       remember, but take time to type.  You may freely mix different option styles, or specify options after the command-line arguments.  Thus you may write:[m
[m
               wget -r --tries=10 http://fly.srk.fer.hr/ -o log[m
[m
       The space between the option accepting an argument and the argument may be omitted.  Instead of [1m-o[0m [1mlog[0m you can write [1m-olog[0m.[m
[m
       You may put several options that do not require arguments together, like:[m
[m
               wget -drc <URL>[m

[m
       [1m-r[0m, [1m--append[0m[m
              Append files to the end of an archive.  Arguments have the same meaning as for [1m-c[0m ([1m--create[0m).[m
[m
       [1m-t[0m, [1m--list[0m[m

[m
       [1m--test-label[0m[m
              Test the archive volume label and exit.  When used without arguments, it prints the volume label (if any) and exits with status [1m0[0m.   When  one  or  more[m

              Append files which are newer than the corresponding copy in the archive.  Arguments have the same meaning as with [1m-c[0m and [1m-r[0m options.  Notice, that newer[m
              files don't replace their old archive copies, but instead are appended to the end of archive.  The resulting archive can thus contain several members of[m

[m
       [1m-x[0m, [1m--extract[0m, [1m--get[0m[m

[m
              When  listing  or  extracting,  the actual contents of [4mFILE[24m is not inspected, it is needed only due to syntactical requirements.  It is therefore common[m

[m

              Use [4mMETHOD[24m to detect holes in sparse files.  This option implies [1m--sparse[0m.  Valid values for [4mMETHOD[24m are [1mseek[0m and [1mraw[0m.  Default is [1mseek[0m with fallback  to[m

              Set  dump  level  for created listed-incremental archive.  Currently only [1m--level=0[0m is meaningful: it instructs [1mtar[0m to truncate the snapshot file before[m
              dumping, thereby forcing a level 0 dump.[m
[m
       [1m-n[0m, [1m--seek[0m[m
              Assume the archive is seekable.  Normally [1mtar[0m determines automatically whether the archive can be seeked or not.  This option is  intended  for  use  in[m
              cases when such recognition fails.  It takes effect only if the archive is open for reading (e.g. with [1m--list[0m or [1m--extract[0m options).[m

[m
[1mDESCRIPTION[0m[m
       GNU Wget is a free utility for non-interactive download of files from the Web.  It supports HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP protocols, as well as retrieval through HTTP[m
       proxies.[m
[m
       Wget is non-interactive, meaning that it can work in the background, while the user is not logged on.  This allows you to start a retrieval and disconnect from[m
       the system, letting Wget finish the work.  By contrast, most of the Web browsers require constant user's presence, which can be a great hindrance when[m
       transferring a lot of data.[m
[m
       Wget can follow links in HTML, XHTML, and CSS pages, to create local versions of remote web sites, fully recreating the directory structure of the original[m
       site.  This is sometimes referred to as "recursive downloading."  While doing that, Wget respects the Robot Exclusion Standard ([4m/robots.txt[24m).  Wget can be[m
       instructed to convert the links in downloaded files to point at the local files, for offline viewing.[m
[m
       Wget has been designed for robustness over slow or unstable network connections; if a download fails due to a network problem, it will keep retrying until the[m
       whole file has been retrieved.  If the server supports regetting, it will instruct the server to continue the download from where it left off.[m
[m
[1mOPTIONS[0m[m
   [1mOption[0m [1mSyntax[0m[m
       Since Wget uses GNU getopt to process command-line arguments, every option has a long form along with the short one.  Long options are more convenient to[m
       remember, but take time to type.  You may freely mix different option styles, or specify options after the command-line arguments.  Thus you may write:[m
[m
               wget -r --tries=10 http://fly.srk.fer.hr/ -o log[m
[m
       The space between the option accepting an argument and the argument may be omitted.  Instead of [1m-o[0m [1mlog[0m you can write [1m-olog[0m.[m
[m
       You may put several options that do not require arguments together, like:[m
[m
               wget -drc <URL>[m
[m
       This is completely equivalent to:[m

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m[m
       [1mgrep[0m  searches  for [4mPATTERNS[24m in each [4mFILE[24m.  [4mPATTERNS[24m is one or more patterns separated by newline characters, and [1mgrep[0m prints each line that matches a pattern.[m
       Typically [4mPATTERNS[24m should be quoted when [1mgrep[0m is used in a shell command.[m
[m
       A [4mFILE[24m of “[1m-[0m” stands for standard input.  If no [4mFILE[24m is given, recursive searches examine the working directory, and nonrecursive searches read standard input.[m
[m
       In addition, the variant programs [1megrep[0m, [1mfgrep[0m and [1mrgrep[0m are the same as [1mgrep[0m [1m-E[0m, [1mgrep[0m [1m-F[0m, and [1mgrep[0m [1m-r[0m, respectively.  These variants are deprecated,  but  are[m

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m[m
       [1mgrep[0m  searches  for [4mPATTERNS[24m in each [4mFILE[24m.  [4mPATTERNS[24m is one or more patterns separated by newline characters, and [1mgrep[0m prints each line that matches a pattern.[m
       Typically [4mPATTERNS[24m should be quoted when [1mgrep[0m is used in a shell command.[m
[m
       A [4mFILE[24m of “[1m-[0m” stands for standard input.  If no [4mFILE[24m is given, recursive searches examine the working directory, and nonrecursive searches read standard input.[m
[m
       In addition, the variant programs [1megrep[0m, [1mfgrep[0m and [1mrgrep[0m are the same as [1mgrep[0m [1m-E[0m, [1mgrep[0m [1m-F[0m, and [1mgrep[0m [1m-r[0m, respectively.  These variants are deprecated,  but  are[m

[m
       To remove a file whose name starts with a '-', for example '-foo', use one of these commands:[m
[m

[m

       Note that if you use rm to remove a file, it might be possible to recover some of its contents, given sufficient expertise and/or time.  For greater  assurance[m
       that the contents are truly unrecoverable, consider using shred.[m

       The SIZE argument is an integer and optional unit (example: 10K is 10*1024).  Units are K,M,G,T,P,E,Z,Y (powers of 1024) or KB,MB,... (powers of 1000).[m
[m
       The TIME_STYLE argument can be full-iso, long-iso, iso, locale, or +FORMAT.  FORMAT is interpreted like in date(1).  If FORMAT is FORMAT1<newline>FORMAT2, then[m
       FORMAT1  applies  to  non-recent  files  and  FORMAT2 to recent files.  TIME_STYLE prefixed with 'posix-' takes effect only outside the POSIX locale.  Also the[m

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m[m
       [4mLess[24m  is  a  program similar to [4mmore[24m (1), but it has many more features.  [4mLess[24m does not have to read the entire input file before starting, so with large input[m
       files it starts up faster than text editors like [4mvi[24m (1).  [4mLess[24m uses termcap (or terminfo on some systems), so it can run on a variety of terminals.   There  is[m
       even limited support for hardcopy terminals.  (On a hardcopy terminal, lines which should be printed at the top of the screen are prefixed with a caret.)[m
[m
       Commands  are  based  on  both [4mmore[24m and [4mvi[24m.  Commands may be preceded by a decimal number, called N in the descriptions below.  The number is used by some com‐[m
       mands, as indicated.[m
[m
[1mCOMMANDS[0m[m
       In the following descriptions, ^X means control-X.  ESC stands for the ESCAPE key; for example ESC-v means the two character sequence "ESCAPE", then "v".[m
[m
       h or H Help: display a summary of these commands.  If you forget all the other commands, remember this one.[m
[m
       SPACE or ^V or f or ^F[m
              Scroll forward N lines, default one window (see option -z below).  If N is more than the screen size, only the final screenful is  displayed.   Warning:[m
              some systems use ^V as a special literalization character.[m
[m
       z      Like SPACE, but if N is specified, it becomes the new window size.[m

              placed by the name of the previously examined file.  "!!" repeats the last shell command.  "!" with no shell command simply invokes a  shell.   On  Unix[m

[1mOPTIONS[0m[m
       Command line options are described below.  Most options may be changed while [4mless[24m is running, via the "-" command.[m
[m
       Most options may be given in one of two forms: either a dash followed by a single letter, or two dashes followed by a long option name.  A long option name may[m
       be  abbreviated  as long as the abbreviation is unambiguous.  For example, --quit-at-eof may be abbreviated --quit, but not --qui, since both --quit-at-eof and[m
       --quiet begin with --qui.  Some long option names are in uppercase, such as --QUIT-AT-EOF, as distinct from --quit-at-eof.  Such option names  need  only  have[m
       their first letter capitalized; the remainder of the name may be in either case.  For example, --Quit-at-eof is equivalent to --QUIT-AT-EOF.[m
[m
       Options are also taken from the environment variable "LESS".  For example, to avoid typing "less -options ..." each time [4mless[24m is invoked, you might tell [4mcsh[24m:[m
[m

              Causes [4mless[24m to automatically exit the second time it reaches end-of-file.  By default, the only way to exit [4mless[24m is via the "q" command.[m

[m
       -f or --force[m
              Forces non-regular files to be opened.  (A non-regular file is a directory or a device special file.)  Also suppresses the warning message when a binary[m
              file  is  opened.  By default, [4mless[24m will refuse to open non-regular files.  Note that some operating systems will not allow directories to be read, even[m
              if -f is set.[m
[m
       -F or --quit-if-one-screen[m
              Causes [4mless[24m to automatically exit if the entire file can be displayed on the first screen.[m
[m
       -g or --hilite-search[m
              Normally, [4mless[24m will highlight ALL strings which match the last search command.  The -g option changes this behavior to  highlight  only  the  particular[m
              string which was found by the last search command.  This can cause [4mless[24m to run somewhat faster than the default.[m
[m
       -G or --HILITE-SEARCH[m
              The -G option suppresses all highlighting of strings found by search commands.[m
[m
       -h[4mn[24m or --max-back-scroll=[4mn[24m[m
              Specifies  a  maximum [7mnumber[27m of lines to scroll backward.  If it is necessary to scroll backward more than [4mn[24m lines, the screen is repainted in a forward[m
              direction instead.  (If the terminal does not have the ability to scroll backward, -h0 is implied.)[m
[m
       -i or --ignore-case[m
              Causes searches to ignore case; that is, uppercase and lowercase are considered identical.  This option is ignored if any uppercase  letters  appear  in[m
              the search pattern; in other words, if a pattern contains uppercase letters, then that search does not ignore case.[m
[m

              tern, jump to a line [7mnumber[27m, jump to a file percentage or jump to a tag.  The screen line may be specified by a [7mnumber[27m: the top line on the screen is 1,[m
              the  next  is 2, and so on.  The [7mnumber[27m may be negative to specify a line relative to the bottom of the screen: the bottom line on the screen is -1, the[m
              second to the bottom is -2, and so on.  Alternately, the screen line may be specified as a fraction of the height of the screen, starting with a decimal[m
              point:  .5  is  in the middle of the screen, .3 is three tenths down from the first line, and so on.  If the line is specified as a fraction, the actual[m
              line [7mnumber[27m is recalculated if the terminal window is resized, so that the target line remains at the specified fraction of the screen height.   If  any[m
              form  of  the  -j  option is used, repeated forward searches (invoked with "n" or "N") begin at the line immediately after the target line, and repeated[m
              backward searches begin at the target line, unless changed by -a or -A.  For example, if "-j4" is used, the target  line  is  the  fourth  line  on  the[m
              screen, so forward searches begin at the fifth line on the screen.  However nonrepeated searches (invoked with "/" or "?")  always begin at the start or[m
              end of the current screen respectively.[m
[m
       -J or --status-column[m
              Displays a status column at the left edge of the screen.  The status column shows the lines that matched the current search,  and  any  lines  that  are[m
              marked (via the m or M command).  The status column is also used if the -w or -W option is in effect.[m
[m
       -k[4mfilename[24m or --lesskey-file=[4mfilename[24m[m
              Causes  [4mless[24m  to open and interpret the named file as a [4mlesskey[24m (1) file.  Multiple -k options may be specified.  If the LESSKEY or LESSKEY_SYSTEM envi‐[m
              ronment variable is set, or if a lesskey file is found in a standard place (see KEY BINDINGS), it is also used as a [4mlesskey[24m file.[m
[m
       -K or --quit-on-intr[m
              Causes [4mless[24m to exit immediately (with status 2) when an interrupt character (usually ^C) is typed.  Normally, an interrupt character causes [4mless[24m to stop[m
              whatever  it  is  doing and return to its command prompt.  Note that use of this option makes it impossible to return to the command prompt from the "F"[m
              command.[m
[m
       -L or --no-lessopen[m
              Ignore the LESSOPEN environment variable (see the INPUT PREPROCESSOR section below).  This option can be set from within [4mless[24m, but it will apply only to[m
[7m Manual page less(1) line 384 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K/[K              files opened subsequently, not to the file which is currently open.[m

       -m or --long-prompt[m
              Causes [4mless[24m to prompt verbosely (like [4mmore[24m), with the percent into the file.  By default, [4mless[24m prompts with a colon.[m
[m
       -M or --LONG-PROMPT[m
              Causes [4mless[24m to prompt even more verbosely than [4mmore[24m.[m
[m
       -n or --line-[7mnumber[27ms[m
              Suppresses  line  [7mnumber[27ms.   The default (to use line [7mnumber[27ms) may cause [4mless[24m to run more slowly in some cases, especially with a very large input file.[m
              Suppressing line [7mnumber[27ms with the -n option will avoid this problem.  Using line [7mnumber[27ms means: the line [7mnumber[27m will be displayed in the verbose  prompt[m
              and in the = command, and the v command will pass the current line [7mnumber[27m to the editor (see also the discussion of LESSEDIT in PROMPTS below).[m

              Causes  [4mless[24m  to copy its input to the named file as it is being viewed.  This applies only when the input file is a pipe, not an ordinary file.  If the[m

[m
       -O[4mfilename[24m or --LOG-FILE=[4mfilename[24m[m
              The -O option is like -o, but it will overwrite an existing file without asking for confirmation.[m
[m
              If no log file has been specified, the -o and -O options can be used from within [4mless[24m to specify a log file.  Without a file name, they will simply  re‐[m
              port the name of the log file.  The "s" command is equivalent to specifying -o from within [4mless[24m.[m
[m
       -p[4mpattern[24m or --pattern=[4mpattern[24m[m
              The -p option on the command line is equivalent to specifying +/[4mpattern[24m; that is, it tells [4mless[24m to start at the first occurrence of [4mpattern[24m in the file.[m
[m
       -P[4mprompt[24m or --prompt=[4mprompt[24m[m
              Provides  a  way  to  tailor the three prompt styles to your own preference.  This option would normally be put in the LESS environment variable, rather[m
              than being typed in with each [4mless[24m command.  Such an option must either be the last option in the LESS variable, or be terminated by a dollar sign.[m
               -Ps followed by a string changes the default (short) prompt to that string.[m
               -Pm changes the medium (-m) prompt.[m
               -PM changes the long (-M) prompt.[m
               -Ph changes the prompt for the help screen.[m

              the  next  is 2, and so on.  The number may be negative to specify a line relative to the bottom of the screen: the bottom line on the screen is -1, the[m
              second to the bottom is -2, and so on.  Alternately, the screen line may be specified as a fraction of the height of the screen, starting with a decimal[m
              point:  .5  is  in the middle of the screen, .3 is three tenths down from the first line, and so on.  If the line is specified as a fraction, the actual[m
              [7mline number[27m is recalculated if the terminal window is resized, so that the target line remains at the specified fraction of the screen height.   If  any[m
              form  of  the  -j  option is used, repeated forward searches (invoked with "n" or "N") begin at the line immediately after the target line, and repeated[m
              backward searches begin at the target line, unless changed by -a or -A.  For example, if "-j4" is used, the target  line  is  the  fourth  line  on  the[m
              screen, so forward searches begin at the fifth line on the screen.  However nonrepeated searches (invoked with "/" or "?")  always begin at the start or[m
              end of the current screen respectively.[m
[m
       -J or --status-column[m
              Displays a status column at the left edge of the screen.  The status column shows the lines that matched the current search,  and  any  lines  that  are[m
              marked (via the m or M command).  The status column is also used if the -w or -W option is in effect.[m
[m
       -k[4mfilename[24m or --lesskey-file=[4mfilename[24m[m
              Causes  [4mless[24m  to open and interpret the named file as a [4mlesskey[24m (1) file.  Multiple -k options may be specified.  If the LESSKEY or LESSKEY_SYSTEM envi‐[m
              ronment variable is set, or if a lesskey file is found in a standard place (see KEY BINDINGS), it is also used as a [4mlesskey[24m file.[m
[m
       -K or --quit-on-intr[m
              Causes [4mless[24m to exit immediately (with status 2) when an interrupt character (usually ^C) is typed.  Normally, an interrupt character causes [4mless[24m to stop[m
              whatever  it  is  doing and return to its command prompt.  Note that use of this option makes it impossible to return to the command prompt from the "F"[m
              command.[m
[m
       -L or --no-lessopen[m
              Ignore the LESSOPEN environment variable (see the INPUT PREPROCESSOR section below).  This option can be set from within [4mless[24m, but it will apply only to[m
              files opened subsequently, not to the file which is currently open.[m
[m
       -m or --long-prompt[m
              Causes [4mless[24m to prompt verbosely (like [4mmore[24m), with the percent into the file.  By default, [4mless[24m prompts with a colon.[m
[m
       -M or --LONG-PROMPT[m
              Causes [4mless[24m to prompt even more verbosely than [4mmore[24m.[m
[m
       -n or --line-numbers[m
              Suppresses  line  numbers.   The default (to use [7mline number[27ms) may cause [4mless[24m to run more slowly in some cases, especially with a very large input file.[m
              Suppressing [7mline number[27ms with the -n option will avoid this problem.  Using [7mline number[27ms means: the [7mline number[27m will be displayed in the verbose  prompt[m
              and in the = command, and the v command will pass the current [7mline number[27m to the editor (see also the discussion of LESSEDIT in PROMPTS below).[m

       -N or --LINE-NUMBERS[m
              Causes a [7mline number[27m to be displayed at the beginning of each line in the display.[m
[m
[7m Manual page less(1) line 400 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K/[K       -o[4mfilename[24m or --log-file=[4mfilename[24m[m
              Causes  [4mless[24m  to copy its input to the named file as it is being viewed.  This applies only when the input file is a pipe, not an ordinary file.  If the[m
              file already exists, [4mless[24m will ask for confirmation before overwriting it.[m
[m
       -O[4mfilename[24m or --LOG-FILE=[4mfilename[24m[m
              The -O option is like -o, but it will overwrite an existing file without asking for confirmation.[m
[m
              If no log file has been specified, the -o and -O options can be used from within [4mless[24m to specify a log file.  Without a file name, they will simply  re‐[m
              port the name of the log file.  The "s" command is equivalent to specifying -o from within [4mless[24m.[m
[m
       -p[4mpattern[24m or --pattern=[4mpattern[24m[m
              The -p option on the command line is equivalent to specifying +/[4mpattern[24m; that is, it tells [4mless[24m to start at the first occurrence of [4mpattern[24m in the file.[m
[m
       -P[4mprompt[24m or --prompt=[4mprompt[24m[m
              Provides  a  way  to  tailor the three prompt styles to your own preference.  This option would normally be put in the LESS environment variable, rather[m
              than being typed in with each [4mless[24m command.  Such an option must either be the last option in the LESS variable, or be terminated by a dollar sign.[m
               -Ps followed by a string changes the default (short) prompt to that string.[m
               -Pm changes the medium (-m) prompt.[m
               -PM changes the long (-M) prompt.[m
               -Ph changes the prompt for the help screen.[m
               -P= changes the message printed by the = command.[m
               -Pw changes the message printed while waiting for data (in the F command).[m
[m
              All prompt strings consist of a sequence of letters and special escape sequences.  See the section on PROMPTS for more details.[m
[m
       -q or --quiet or --silent[m
              Causes moderately "quiet" operation: the terminal bell is not rung if an attempt is made to scroll past the end of the file or before the  beginning  of[m
              the file.  If the terminal has a "visual bell", it is used instead.  The bell will be rung on certain other errors, such as typing an invalid character.[m
              The default is to ring the terminal bell in all such cases.[m

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m[m
       [1mVim[0m is a text editor that is upwards compatible to Vi.  It can be used to edit all kinds of plain text.  It is especially useful for editing programs.[m
[m
       There  are a lot of enhancements above Vi: multi level undo, multi windows and buffers, syntax highlighting, command line editing, filename completion, on-line[m
       help, visual selection, etc..  See ":help vi_diff.txt" for a summary of the differences between [1mVim[0m and Vi.[m
[m
       While running [1mVim[0m a lot of help can be obtained from the on-line help system, with the ":help" command.  See the ON-LINE HELP section below.[m
[m
       Most often [1mVim[0m is started to edit a single file with the command[m
[m
            vim file[m
[m
       More generally [1mVim[0m is started with:[m
[m
            vim [options] [filelist][m
[m
       If the filelist is missing, the editor will start with an empty buffer.  Otherwise exactly one out of the following four may be used  to  choose  one  or  more[m
       files to be edited.[m
[m
       file ..     A list of filenames.  The first one will be the current file and read into the buffer.  The cursor will be positioned on the first line of the buf‐[m
                   fer.  You can get to the other files with the ":next" command.  To edit a file that starts with a dash, precede the filelist with "--".[m
